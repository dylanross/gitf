Generic science fiction turn-based RPG system, somewhat based on simplification
of Games Workshop's Inquisitor.

Currently at a fairly early stage of development. There is not yet a system for
player input, but there is an extremely rudimentary AI and bots can be pitted
against each other (this is the default behaviour when main() executes). The
map system will be next to be developed; currently events occur in a
dimensionless void.
